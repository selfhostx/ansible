Purpose and principles
======================

This collection should enable self-hosters full control of their infrastructure and data (GDPR-focus when external services are used).
It will be OSS forever and everyone should be able to integrate it into their infrastructure (or product).
We do not re-invent the wheel, if there is a good role or collection somewhere else: we won`t duplicate it (unless important features are missing).

supported distributions:
  - Debian (all supported versions)
  - Ubuntu (supported LTS-Versions)
  - Redhat-based distribution (permanent - if maintainer is found - or best-effort-basis)

2DO in general:
  - CI (travis, gitlab runner, ...?)

Requirements
------------

minimum ansible version: 2.10

Role requirements
-----------------

good documentation (preferably a link to a basic user documentation too)

example playbook

proper code formatting (ansible-lint)

classify variables per role
- required (execution fails if not defined)
- recommended (common customization)
- optional (less commonly changed)

dependencies
- other roles
- neede pip-modules on target

definition of variables and dependencies (see above) need to be machine-readable to enable automation/custom GUIs) -> 2DO define fileformat!

python3 is required

active maintainers!


Dependencies
------------

FIXME Link requirements-file
FIXME list all include_role in requirements-file

FAQ

Q: Why not plain shellscripts?
A: Shellscript have full flexibility ... but you`ll need to implement everything yourself:
- templating with condition and variable expansion
- handlers (run action when certain condition are met, i.e. restart service only when config is changed via template)
- are not idempotent (it does not have the same result when you run it again)
- re-implement code stuff that is already available today (ansible galaxy has tons of code)
- validate config for services that offer it (i.e. prevent broken sudo configs ...)
- automated/unattended run (installations are not always done interactivly done by a humans!)
- check-mode (-C) has the ability to show what changes would have been applied
- error-handling: try to trap errors with pipefail ... that blows up code massively. Example for error-handling in bash (how many of your scripts does implement something similar?):
~~~
set -eo pipefail

cleanup() {
# remove temp files
}
trap cleanup 0

error() {
  local parent_lineno="$1"
  local message="$2"
  local code="${3:-1}"
  if [[ -n "$message" ]] ; then
    error_message="Error on or near line ${parent_lineno}: ${message}; exiting with status ${code}"
  else
    error_message="Error on or near line ${parent_lineno}; exiting with status ${code}"
  fi
  echo "$error_message" # for cron
  exit "${code}"
}
trap 'error ${LINENO}' ERR
~~~
